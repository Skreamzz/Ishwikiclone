If something particularly weird is going on, it can help me debug if you send me all the files in your install of iSH. Here's how:

- Press and hold the settings button/(i) for 5 seconds
- Tap "export container"
- Plug your device into a computer
- Open the device in iTunes
- Find iSH in the list of apps with file sharing
- Send me the directory called "roots copy"
