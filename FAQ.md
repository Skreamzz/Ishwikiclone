## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: X does not work!
**A:** Not surprising. Much of the emulation is still not finished, and many programs *will* fail. Do not hesitate to create [an issue](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/issues/new) if the specific program is not already on the [to-do list](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/projects/7), as it will be brought to the attention of the contributors, and they will (eventually) make it work.

### Q: When is the next TestFlight build coming out?
**A:** Soon.:tm:
