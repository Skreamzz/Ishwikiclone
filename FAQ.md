## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: X does not work!
**A:** Not surprising. Much of the emulation is still not finished, and many programs *will* fail. Do not hesitate to create [an issue](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/issues/new) if the specific program is not already on the [to-do list](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/projects/7), as it will be brought to the attention of the contributors, and they will (eventually) make it work. You can also check out [this page](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/wiki/What-works%3F) on the wiki where users actively test common programs.

### Q: When is the next TestFlight build coming out?
**A:** Sooner than it took for build 32 to come out. New builds are more frequent, and the app will be updated when something new has been added or fixed.
