[iSH](https://ish.app) is a project to get a Linux shell environment running locally on your iOS device, using a usermode x86 emulator. This is the wiki, where you can find installation instructions and common troubleshooting tips.

There is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SndDh5y) if you have any questions or concerns, or if you just want to chat.
A [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ishapp/) for discussions and a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ish_app) also exist.
