# Welcome to the iSH wiki!

I want to put some technical documentation and stuff here, but I haven't actually gotten around to it yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, so check the sidebar for a list of pages.

### Ideas for pages

* How to use debug logging (or should that go in HACKING.md?)
* How the "JIT" actually works

If you want to help out by writing documentation on iSH, go ahead and create a page. It's a wiki, after all.

**Please note that the tutorials here assume that `apk` is installed. If it isn't (`apk not found`), install it by following the steps [here](https://github.com/ish-app/ish/wiki/Installing-apk-on-the-App-Store-Version).**
