# Welcome to the iSH wiki!

I want to put some technical documentation and stuff here, but I haven't actually gotten around to it yet. That might have changed by the time you read this, check the sidebar for a list of pages.

Ideas for pages:

* List of working and non-working programs (in addition to [the project](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/projects/7) I guess)
* How to use debug logging (or should that go in HACKING.md?)
* How the "JIT" actually works

If you want to help out by writing documentation on iSH, go ahead and create a page. It's a wiki, after all.
