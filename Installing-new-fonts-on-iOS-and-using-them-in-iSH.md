# Fonts in iSH

Fonts don’t work in iSH as they do in a typical Unix configuration, and iSH usually only likes monospaced. Individual fonts have to be installed on the iOS/iPadOS device before they can be used by iSH. There is currently no way to change the font programmatically. Follow these instructions to install new fonts:

## Method 1 (iFont)
    • Get [iFont](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifont-find-install-any-font/id1173222289)
    • Follow instructions within iFont to install new monospaced fonts
    • Open iSH and tap the settings cog.
    • In *Appearance* / *Font*, select your newly installed font.
    • If necessary, restart iSH
    • Profit.
