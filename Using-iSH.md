## Getting started with the iSH app itself
If you do not want to compile the project from source, you can [get iSH on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243) or [join the TestFlight Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/97i7KM8O)! It's free and gives you an instant download of the app.

## In iSH

When you have iSH on your device, you can open it. You'll be greeted with the terminal. Here are some important tips:
- iSH uses the Alpine Package Manager, `apk`. You may have to run `apk update` to fetch the Alpine repository list.
- When Alpine is up-to-date, you can search for a program with `apk search <name>` and install it with `apk add <name>`.
- Above the keyboard you can see the Accessory View, and it contains crucial buttons. Starting from the left, the buttons are `tab`, `control`, `escape`, `arrow keys`, `settings`, `paste` and `hiding the keyboard` (which, was formerly more formally known as the `black down pointed triangle`). These added keys will help you navigate around.
