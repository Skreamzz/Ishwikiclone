## Make a backup!

If you have any worthwhile data in your file system, you really should do a backup before any major operation on the file system!

Do this by going into Settings - Filesystems - Select the one labeled as "Mounted at /" - Export. Once it is compressed you can select a location and name for this export.

If something goes wrong, all you need to do is to go to Settings - Filesystems - import 
and select your exported FS
