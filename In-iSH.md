## Getting started with the iSH app itself
If you do not want to compile the project from source, you can join the [TestFlight beta program](https://testflight.apple.com/join/97i7KM8O)! It's free and gives you an instant download of the app.

## In iSH
When you have iSH on your device, you can open it. You'll be greeted with the terminal. Here are some important tips:
- iSH uses the Alpine Package Manager, `apk`. You will have to run `apk update` to fetch the Alpine repository list.
- When Alpine is up-to-date, you can search for a program with `apk search <name>` and install it with `apk install <name>`.
- Above the keyboard you can see the Accessory View, and it contains crucial buttons. Starting from the left, the buttons are `tab`, `control`, `escape`, `arrow keys`, `settings` and `hiding the keyboard` (which, is more formally known as `black down pointed triangle`). These modified keys will help you navigate around.
